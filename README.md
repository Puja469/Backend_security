## Security Summary

The ThriftStore application implements a comprehensive security framework with multiple layers of protection:

- Authentication and Authorization: JWT tokens, 2FA, role-based access control
- Data Protection: Input sanitization, XSS prevention, CSRF protection
- File Security: Upload validation, MIME type checking, virus scanning
- Network Security: HTTPS, security headers, CORS protection
- Monitoring: Activity logging, security dashboard, real-time analytics
- Bot Prevention: CAPTCHA integration, rate limiting, suspicious activity detection

All security features are production-ready and follow industry best practices for web application security.

## Security Architecture

### Multi-Layer Security Approach

The application implements a layered security architecture:

- Frontend Layer: CSRF token management, secure cookie handling, input validation
- Gateway Layer: Rate limiting, security headers, CORS configuration, request validation
- Authentication Layer: JWT token validation, 2FA OTP verification, session management, role-based access control
- Business Layer: Input sanitization, file upload security, database query security, activity logging
- Data Layer: MongoDB injection prevention, data encryption, secure connections, backup security

### Security Flow

1. Request Arrival: Rate limiting and security headers applied
2. Authentication: JWT validation, 2FA if required, role checking
3. Input Processing: Validation, sanitization, suspicious activity detection
4. Business Logic: Secure operations with activity logging
5. Data Access: Sanitized queries with injection prevention
6. Response: Secure headers, error handling, logging
